# Orpheus

Orpheus introduces the `:Qall` and the `:Nde` (Near Death Experience) commands.

The `Qall` command mimic the `qall` command but if some buffers are unsaved and
the `!` flag is not present it displays all the unsaved buffer in one screen.

The `Qall!` is a synonymous of `qall!`.

The `Nde` command displays all the unsaved buffer in one screen.
